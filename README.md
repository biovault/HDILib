# HDILib: High Dimensional Inspector Library
HDILib is a library for the scalable analysis of large and high-dimensional data.
It contains scalable manifold-learning algorithms, visualizations and visual-analytics frameworks.
HDILib is implemented in C++, OpenGL and JavaScript.
It is developed within a joint collaboration between the [Computer Graphics & Visualization](https://graphics.tudelft.nl/) group at the [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl) and the [Division of Image Processing (LKEB)](https://www.lumc.nl/org/radiologie/research/LKEB/) at the [Leiden Medical Center](https://www.lumc.nl/).

## Authors
- [Nicola Pezzotti](http://nicola17.github.io/) initiated the HDI project, developed the A-tSNE and HSNE algorithms and implemented most of the visualizations and frameworks.
- [Thomas HÃ¶llt](https://www.thomashollt.com/) ported the library to MacOS.

## Used
HDI is used in the following projects:
- [Cytosplore](https://www.cytosplore.org/): interactive system for understanding how the immune system works
- [Brainscope](http://www.brainscope.nl/brainscope): web portal for fast,
interactive visual exploration of the [Allen Atlases](http://www.brain-map.org/) of the adult and developing human brain
transcriptome
- [DeepEyes](https://graphics.tudelft.nl/Publications-new/2018/PHVLEV18/): progressive analytics system for designing deep neural networks

## Building
On Ubuntu 16.04 you can build and install HDI by running the following commands

```bash
./scripts/install-dependencies.sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j 8
sudo make install
```

### Windows build with conan for dependencies

 - In a python (3.6 or 3.7) environment: 
``` 
pip install conan
```
 - Add the biovault conan remote (for prebuilt packages):
```
conan remote add conan-biovault http://cytosplore.lumc.nl:8081/artifactory/api/conan/conan-local
```
 - Make a build directory below the HDILib project root. 
    For example: *./_build_release* or *./_build_debug*
    (<u>when using conan the source directories are shared but 
    separate build directories should be used for release and debug.</u>)
 - In the python environment (with conan and cmake accessible) 
 cd to the build directory and issue the following (for VisualStudio 2017):
``` 
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DHDILIB_BUILD_WITH_CONAN=ON
```      
    (*Note: this assumes that the build dir is one level down from the project root.
    The default of HDILIB_BUILD_WITH_CONAN is OFF*)
 - If all goes well Conan will have installed the dependencies in its cache and 
 created the required defines for the Cmake configuration.
 Open the .sln in VisualStudio and build ALL_BUILD for Release or Debug matching the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.
     On Windows the result of the build are three *.lib files


## Applications

A suite of command line and visualization applications is available in the [original High Dimensional Inspector](https://github.com/biovault/High-Dimensional-Inspector) repository.
